# Overview of Labs 7 and 8 (t-tests)

| lab | test | purpose | design |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 7a | one-sample t-test | Compare sample mean to a hypothetical population mean | One group |
| **7b** | **paired-sample t-test** | **Compare two sample means in a within-subjects design** | **Same subjects are measured across both levels of the experimental manipulation (independent variable)** |
| 8 | independent-sample t-test | Compare two sample means in a between-subjects design | Different subjects are measured across both levels of the experimental manipulation (independent variable) |

For each of these labs, we will
- ask a research question appropriate for the test
- get a result in Jamovi
- APA report of result

This lab is about the paired-sample t-test.

Could my difference-scores have come from a distribution with a mean of zero?

When would you ever ask this question?

Whenever each participant is measured across two levels of an experimental manipulation.

Here are examples that measure the same thing (dependent variable) before and after some manipulation (independent variable):

- each person's bodyweight measured before and after a fitness program
- each person's tendency to take risks before and after exposure to news of a possible war

And here is an example that measures the same thing (dependent variable) in two different manipulations (independent variable):

- each person's tendency to take risks after exposure to news of peace, and after exposure to news of war

### What can we write?
>> At test, however, the infants selectively attended to the now-silent singer of the song with the familiar melody; the proportion of time during which they looked toward her was greater than the proportion at baseline (difference in proportion of looking: M = .072, SD = .169, 95% CI = [.011, .133]), t(31) = 2.42, p = .022, d = 0.43 (paired t test; see Fig. 2a).
