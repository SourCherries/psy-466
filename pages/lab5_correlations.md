# Lab 5: Correlations

## Set up

### Sources of data for this lab
We use data from the [World Happiness Report](http://worldhappiness.report/). A .csv of the data can be found here: [WHR2018.csv](/psy-466/data/WHR2018.csv)

### Simulations {#simulations-id}

#### Clean up
We are making up our own data here. So we want a fresh new Jamovi session without any existing data. If you have already opened the WHR2018.csv file then you can close and reopen Jamovi.

By default, Jamovi creates 3 nominal variables called ```A```, ```B``` and ```C```. Let's get rid of these variables. Select those columns then ```Data > Delete``` to remove them.

Before we make fake data, we need one more step.

#### Telling Jamovi that we should have 10 people {#want-10}
Let's create a new variable for all of the fake people in our data set: ```Data > Setup > NEW DATA VARIABLE```

The variable name is ```A``` by default. Rename this variable ```person``` and set the variable type as **ID** instead of **Nominal**.

Now we are ready to tell Jamovi that there are 10 people in our data.
