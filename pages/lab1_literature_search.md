You've heard of the distinction between *satisficers* and *maximizers* and this is something that interests you but you're not sure where to start looking in the academic literature. So you turn to science journalism.

You search [the conversation](https://theconversation.com/ca/) for the term *satisficing* and end up with a list of 5 results.

[The article](https://theconversation.com/how-ageing-affects-the-way-we-make-decisions-58607) with **make decisions** in the title seems promising because that's what you care about the most - how people make decisions.

You read it and the author does not start talking about *satisficing* until the final section entitled **Keeping it simple**. In this section, 2 studies are described.

## Question 1
Of these 2 studies, which study is more likely to be cited the most by other papers? I am looking for 2 reasons here but perhaps there are other factors I am not considering.

# Google Scholar
## Question 2
Write down the references for the 2 articles discussed in the previous question. Please use APA format. There's a quick way to get APA-formatted references in Google Scholar.

## Question 3
Which of the 2 articles discussed in the previous question has more citations? Please write down their citation numbers here. The paper with the higher citation count is probably an important one. Not only does it have a high citation count, but it is also mentioned in an article written for a general audience. I'm just using a rule-of-thumb here; does not always work. But as it turns out, this article is very important.

# PsychInfo from ZU Library
## Question 4
Download a copy of the **important** article from the previous question. Please upload a copy of this article to XXXXXXX on Blackboard to get a mark for this question.

## Question 5
The paper you downloaded describes the use of a questionnaire to measure the degree to which someone either **satisfices** (on one end of a scale) or **maximizes** (on the other end of the scale). Did the authors make up this scale for this particular study? Or did they use a scale designed by someone else?

# Google Scholar
You think about the distinction between **maximizing** and **satisficing** and become curious about how someone might make decisions for other people. For example, does a **satisficer** stick to the strategy of **satisficing** when they are making decisions for someone that they care about, especially when it comes to *matchmaking*? In case you're wondering, *matchmaking* is the act of bringing people together for a potential relationship or marriage.

## Question 6
Has anyone done research on how **satisficers** and **maximizers** might behave when matchmaking? In order to find out, use Google Scholar to find all the papers that cite the **important** paper and also have certain keywords in the title. We will use the keywords "others", "matchmaking" and "matchmaker". We want all papers with any one of these keywords in the title, and also cite the **important paper**.

## Question 7
I get 4 results. Please write your 4 results. Do any of them have to do with matchmaking?

## Question 8
Which of these 4 results is most relevant to our research question? Does it have to do with matchmaking?

## Question 9
Click on the most relevant paper and find the **keywords**, listed below the **Abstract**. Write them down here. **These keywords are very useful**. They refer to the actual terms that researchers use when discussing the topic that is central to our research question!

# PsychInfo
## Question 10
Now that we know some of the important keywords used when researchers discuss how **maximizers** and **satisficers** make decisions for others, we can also search PsychInfo for combinations of these keywords and either *matchmaker*, *matchmaking*, *relationship*, *marriage*, *partner* or *romantic*. What do we get?
