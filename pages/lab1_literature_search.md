You've heard of the distinction between *satisficers* and *maximizers* and this is something that interests you but you're not sure where to start looking in the academic literature. So you turn to science journalism.

You search [the conversation](https://theconversation.com/ca/) for the term *satisficing* and end up with a list of 5 results.

[The article](https://theconversation.com/how-ageing-affects-the-way-we-make-decisions-58607) with **make decisions** in the title seems promising because that's what you care about the most - how people make decisions.

The author does not start talking about *satisficing* until the final section entitled **Keeping it simple**. Read the section **Keeping it simple** at the end of [this article](https://theconversation.com/how-ageing-affects-the-way-we-make-decisions-58607). Two studies are described. The following question asks about these studies.

## Question 1
Of the 2 studies mentioned in **Keeping it simple** of [this article](https://theconversation.com/how-ageing-affects-the-way-we-make-decisions-58607), which study is more likely to be cited the most by other psychologists in their published research?

I am looking for 2 reasons here but perhaps there are other factors I am not considering. This question requires thinking. Perhaps common sense.

# Google Scholar
## Question 2
Write down the references for the 2 articles discussed in the previous question. You can find the references by clicking on the links within [the blog article](https://theconversation.com/how-ageing-affects-the-way-we-make-decisions-58607). Please make sure the references are formatted according to [APA format](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples/journal-article-references).

There's a quick way to get APA-formatted references in Google Scholar. Is there anything missing from the references if you search for it this way? What was missing?

PsychInfo is more reliable. If you find references in Google Scholar, you should check for anything that might be missing. Yes, you will be marked for proper references on your senior project and perhaps any report that requires APA formatting in this class.

## Question 3
Which of the 2 articles discussed in the previous question ~~has more citations~~ **is cited more often**? Please write down their citation numbers here.

The paper with the higher citation count is probably an important one. Not only does it have a high citation count, but it is also mentioned in an article written for a general audience. I'm just using a rule-of-thumb here; does not always work. But as it turns out, this article is very important.

# ZU Library
## Question 4
Download a copy of the **important** article from the previous question. Please upload a pdf copy of this article to **Lab 1 - Literature Search** (Instructor's Assessments) on Blackboard to get a mark for this question. Note that since you already know the title of the article, you can just use QuickFind from the main page of ZU Library.

## Question 5
The paper you downloaded describes the use of a questionnaire to measure the degree to which someone either **satisfices** (on one end of a scale) or **maximizes** (on the other end of the scale). Did the authors make up this scale for this particular study? Or did they use a scale designed by someone else?

HINT: Remember that an empirical research paper has different sections: Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion. Each section may have a subsection; for example, Method may contain a Materials subjection if a questionnaire is used.

# Google Scholar
You think about the distinction between **maximizing** and **satisficing** and become curious about how someone might make decisions for other people. For example, does a **satisficer** stick to the strategy of **satisficing** when they are making decisions for someone that they care about, especially when it comes to *matchmaking*? In case you're wondering, *matchmaking* is the act of bringing people together for a potential relationship or marriage.

## Question 6
Has anyone done research on how **satisficers** and **maximizers** might behave when matchmaking? In order to find out, use Google Scholar to find all the papers that cite the **important** paper and also have certain keywords in the title. We will use the keywords "others", "matchmaking" and "matchmaker". We want all papers with any one of these keywords in the title, and also cite the **important paper**.

I get 4 results. Please write the references for your 4 results in APA format.

## Question 7
Judging from the titles alone, do any of them have to do with matchmaking?

## Question 8
Which of these 4 results is most relevant to our research question?

Download and quickly read through it. Does this paper have to do with matchmaking?

## Question 9
Click on the most relevant paper and find the **keywords**, listed below the **Abstract**. Write them down here.

**These keywords are very useful**. They refer to the actual terms that researchers use when discussing the topic that is central to our research question!

# General
## Question 10
How might we look for any studies that might have examined how **maximizers** and **satisficers** might behave when matchmaking?
