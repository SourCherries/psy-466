This course has a heavy focus on hands-on activities, done on most weeks. All of this will be done using free software called jamovi (like SPSS), which has been used for published and peer-reviewed research.

**When is my next lab and how can I start?**
Find the current week on **Weekly Outline** (below) and check if there is a lab listed under **activity**. If the lab is currently available, there should be a link. Click on that link to begin. Labs are generally on the 2nd day of the week, and we will have a meeting over Zoom where I can offer guidance while do the lab on your own.

If the lab is available before class time, feel free to begin the lab on your own. But you must still attend!

The labs are very structured and marked in a consistent fashion:
1. **Learning**. 1 point.
  - You do stuff step-by-step.
  - Pass = you must attend the lab and hand in your assignment with a completed part 1.
  - Fail = you don't attend lab; or you do, but you don't hand in your assignment.
2. **Generalization**. 2 points.
  - You apply what you just learned to answer similar questions.
  - Pass = you must attend the lab and hand in your assignment with a completed part 2.
  - Fail = you don't attend lab; or you do, but you don't hand in your assignment.
3. **Think and write** 2 points.
  - Short answer questions.
  - I grade it and give you feedback.
  - Each question will come with a clear rubric about how the question will be graded.

| week | from | to | topic | activity | do before the next week |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|1| 8/23 | 8/27 | Introduction to the course. | ►**3:00 pm:** Review syllabus. Preview of this website. ►Students will be directed to the Student Code of Academic Conduct Procedures (ACA-ADM-08) and we will discuss the importance academic integrity. ►**3:40 pm:** Ungraded quiz.| ►[1.7 Psychological measurement](https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/why-statistics.html#introduction-to-psychological-measurement), [1.8 Scales of measurement](https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/why-statistics.html#scales-of-measurement), [1.10 The role of variables](https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/why-statistics.html#the-role-of-variables-predictors-and-outcomes), [1.11 Experimental & non-experimental research](https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/why-statistics.html#experimental-and-non-experimental-research) ►[Jamovi install](https://www.jamovi.org/user-manual.html#installation), and [getting started](https://www.jamovi.org/user-manual.html#getting-started).|
|2| 8/30 | 9/03 | ►Science and statistics. ►Review of basic concepts like variable types. Research designs. | ►Lecture/slides. ►Discussion of ungraded quiz. | |
|3| 9/06 | 9/10 | ►Dataset detective work. ►Mini Research Paper. | ►Lectures/slides.  ►Detailed discussion of Mini Research Paper. ►Lab 1: Data set detective work. Students explore raw data and apply their knowledge of research methods to infer the design used in the original study, and the variable types included. We will revisit mystery data sets periodically and students can judge whether a newly learnt analysis or measurement can be meaningfully applied. A shared Google document will track our understanding of the various data sets. By the following week, students will *adopt* a dataset which will form the basis of their Mini Research Paper. | |
|4| 9/13 | 9/17 | Data visualization. | ►Lecture/slides. ►[Lab 2: Graphing PREVIEW](pages/lab1_visualization.html). ►By the end of this week, students must have *adopted* a mystery dataset for themselves; a different one for each student. Once *adopted*, students can now begin work on their Mini Research Paper. As we progress through the course, students will be able to do more and more. Labs 1 and 2 due 09/19| |
|5| 9/20 | 9/24 | ►Central tendency. | ►Lecture/slides. ►Lab 3: More graphing (website TBA) | |
|6| 9/27 | 10/01 | ►Variance. | ►Lecture/slides. ►Lab 4: Descriptives (website TBA) | |
|7| 10/04 | 10/08 | ►Correlation. | Lecture/slides. ►Lab 5: Correlation (website TBA)| |
|8| 10/11 | 10/15 | ►Regression. | ►Lecture/slides. ►Continue lab 5: Correlation (website TBA) | |

|14| 11/22 | 11/26 | ►Repeated measures ANOVA. | ►Lecture/slides. ►Lab 10: Repeated measures ANOVA (website TBA). Labs 7 to 10 due 11/28.| |
|15| 11/29 | 12/03 | ►Additional guidance with Mini Research Paper. | ►Individual discussions about Mini Research Paper. | |
